* The project was divided into three main components; Multiagent system interface  which is developed using python with development library CrewAI that formulate an hierarchical MAS with one master and clients and The reasoning and comparisons to evaluate the value of different items up for trade using knowledge base with semantic network and interface API using fastAPI in python to feed and interact with the system and user.


# Results
