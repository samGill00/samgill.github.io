## Assignments

#### Creating RDBMS and testing
* I was assigned a university project to design a relational database schema using MySQL Workbench. The task involved testing the schema with Python, to make sure the database is usable for the client. 

* Design a normalized schema with constraints and relationships. Populate it with synthetic data and ensure efficient querying using indexes and hashing. 

* Created the schema in Workbench and exported SQL. Used SQLAlchemy to define models, insert Faker data that matches the strict type of the tables and constraints, and added indexes and hash-based keys for faster lookups.

* Built a performant, well-structured database with realistic test data. Queries ran efficiently, and the project showcased strong integration of design, testing, and optimization, which resuted in 85% marking.

#### Developing a recommendation system using Pearson Correlation with parallel data mining with RSS
* I was assigned a university project to build a recommendation system using Pearson Correlation. The system needed to mine RSS feeds in parallel and process user-item data efficiently.

* Develop a content-based recommender that analyzes similarity scores. Implement scalable data mining and transformation using map and reduce functions.

* Used Python to fetch RSS feeds concurrently and extract metadata. Applied map-reduce to transform user-item matrices and compute Pearson scores for recommendations.

* Delivered a responsive system with accurate, real-time suggestions. Optimized performance through parallelism and functional programming techniques.


#### Developing an autonomous robot performing identification and locating using Ros2 with SLAM and NAV
* I was tasked with building an autonomous robot for a university project. It needed to identify and locate objects using ROS2, SLAM, and navigation modules.

* Develop a robot capable of real-time mapping and path planning. Integrate object recognition with autonomous movement and localization.

* Used ROS2 to coordinate SLAM and NAV stacks for dynamic mapping. Implemented identification using camera feeds and trained models for object detection.

* Delivered a robot that successfully navigated and located targets in unknown environments. Achieved reliable autonomy with accurate mapping and identification.
